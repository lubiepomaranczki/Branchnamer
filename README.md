# Branchnamer
Branchname is a Chrome extesion for Azure Devops that generates the name for the branch which makes your work quicker as you don't have to type the name on your own.

## Example
Let's assume you have a PBI _#3387 - Create login page_. If you click on Branchnamer logo it will open a pop up in which you will have the name of the branch `3387-create-login-page`. Simple as that.

## Usage
If you want to use it, download/clone the repository to the selected location.
In the next step, open Chrome and tap on tree dots in a column (top right corner). Later _More tools->Extensions->Load unpacked_ and select the folder which contains the repository. Voila! You are good to go.

### Disclaimer
I am aware there are bugs in this extension. I try to solve them when I have a time. Unfortunately, I don't write Chrome extensions on a daily basis and sometimes it's hard. If you want to contribute, please don't hestitate to do so. Right now there are is no contribute.md neither there is "code of conduct". Just make a PR
